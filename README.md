In order to use the file just download the toolrunner.py.

NOTE- The original py file has certain executable paths already defined which will be DIFFERENT from your machine-in order to make changes:
1- Use any IDE or code editor with python and open the py file
2- Type in the path to the executable (including the exe file itself) in the path list
eg- in order to open test.exe in downloads-the file path should look this:
C/downloads/test.exe
